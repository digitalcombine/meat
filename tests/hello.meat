# Notes
#   Since we need gitgo to compile this file, the 'ᶲ' character found in all
#  the class names is to prevent collisions with the builtin in classes. Once
#  the cpp file is generated then the ᶲ characters are stripped out.
#   The generate cpp file is still not valid because all the hash values are
#  included in the name hashing...
