\subsection {Context Class}

\indent{}A context is the execution context when a method answers a message.

\begin{lstlisting}
Object subClass: Context body: {
  method messenger
  method localVariables
  method getLocal: index
  method setLocal: index to: value
  method return
  method return: result
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection {method messenger}
\indent{}This method returns the context object where the message was
initiated. The null object can be returned if it was the very first context
created to start execution.
