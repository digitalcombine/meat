\subsection {Object Class}

The Object class is the base class for all objects and classes in the
Meat virtual machine.

\begin{lstlisting}
Object subClass: Object body: {
  class method == other
  class method != other
  class method is: other
  class method isNot: other
  class method isObject
  class method isClass
  class method isNull
  class method type
  method initialize
  method == other
  method != other
  method is: other
  method isNot: other
  method isObject
  method isClass
  method isNull
  method type
  method isType: class
  method weak
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection {The == methods}
\begin{lstlisting}
  class method == other
  method == other
\end{lstlisting}

Tests if the \textit{other} object or class is the identical object
to self. For this class, it does not test the equality of values, but
sub-classes should override this method to test for value equality. The
result is to be either the True or False Boolean objects.

\hfill
\subsubsection {The != methods}
\begin{lstlisting}
  class method != other
  method != other
\end{lstlisting}

Tests if the \textit{other} object or class is not the same object
as self. For this class, it does not test the inequality of values, but
sub-classes should override this method to test for value inequality. The
result is to be either the True or False Boolean objects.

\hfill
\subsubsection {The is: methods}
\begin{lstlisting}
  class method is: other
  method is: other
\end{lstlisting}

Tests if the \textit{other} object or class is the identical object
to self. This method should not be overridden. The result is to be either the
True or False Boolean objects.

\hfill
\subsubsection {The isNot: methods}
\begin{lstlisting}
  class method isNot: other
  method isNot: other
\end{lstlisting}

Tests if the \textit{other} object or class is not the same object
as self. This method should not be overridden. The result is to be either the
True or False Boolean objects.

\hfill
\subsubsection {The isObject methods}

Tests if the object is an object. The result is to be either the
True or False Boolean objects.\\

The class method with always return the False object and the object method will
always return the True object.

\hfill
\subsubsection {The isClass methods}

Tests if the object is a class. The result is to be either the
True or False Boolean objects.\\

The class method with always return the True object and the object method will
always return the False object.

\hfill
\subsubsection {The isNull methods}
\begin{lstlisting}
  class method isNull
  method isNull
\end{lstlisting}

Tests if the object or class is the Null object. These methods should always
return the False object.

\hfill
\subsubsection {The type methods}
\begin{lstlisting}
  class method type
  method type
\end{lstlisting}

Returns the type class for the object. The class method should always return
the class Class.

\hfill
\subsubsection {method initialize}
When a class creates a new object (see newObject) this method is messaged
to populate the objects properties with sane default values. This method
should be overridden by every sub-class and must always call it's super
class.

\begin{lstlisting}
  method initialize {
    super initialize
    # Populate object's properties here.
  }
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection {method weak}

Returns a weak reference to the object that does not affect the normal
memory management reference counting.
