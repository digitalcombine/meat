\subsection {Object Class}

\indent{}The Object class is the base class for all objects and classes in the
Meat virtual machine.

\begin{lstlisting}
Object subClass: Object body: {
  class method == other
  class method != other
  class method isObject
  class method isClass
  class method isNull
  class method type
  method initialize
  method == other
  method != other
  method isObject
  method isClass
  method isNull
  method type
  method isType: class
  method weak
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection {The == methods}
\begin{lstlisting}
  class method == other
  method == other
\end{lstlisting}
\indent{}Tests if the \textit{other} object or class is the identical object to self.
This does not test the equality of values. The result is to be either the True
or False Boolean objects.

\hfill
\subsubsection {The != methods}
\begin{lstlisting}
  class method != other
  method != other
\end{lstlisting}
Tests if the \textit{other} object or class is not identical object to self.
This does not test the inequality of values. The result is to be either the
True or False Boolean objects.

\hfill
\subsubsection {The isObject methods}

Tests if the object is an object. The result is to be either the
True or False Boolean objects.\\

The class method with always return the False object and the object method will
always return the True object.

\hfill
\subsubsection {The isClass methods}

Tests if the object is a class. The result is to be either the
True or False Boolean objects.\\

The class method with always return the True object and the object method will
always return the False object.

\hfill
\subsubsection {The type methods}
