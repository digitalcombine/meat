\subsection{Class Class}

The class Class is the base type for all Class objects.

\begin{lstlisting}
Object subClass: Class body: {
  class method subClass: name body: definition
  class method newObject
  class method superClass
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{class method subClass: name body: definition}
This method should raise an Exception. The functionality for this method
is to be provided by a compiler library. How a compiler library hooks in the
functionaliy is up to the underlying implementation and is not defined here.

\subsubsection{class method newObject}
\label{sec:class_method_newobject}
Method used for creating constructor class methods. This method creates a new
object and sets the self object to it then messages \textit{self initialize}.

All constructor methods should follow the following template:

\begin{lstlisting}
class method new {
  self newObject
  # Add any additional object initialization here.
  context return: self
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{class method superClass}
Returns the super class for the Class.
