All the stuff that still needs to be done to the Meat language.

* Finish the runtime environment
- Implement a unicode library for Text classes.
  - For the most part the library is good, just the get and length methods
    need to handle the unicode characters.
- Finish implementing the Compiler classes
- Finish implementing the Library class

* Compiler improvements
- Constants tracked to be reused instead of creating duplicate bytecode.
- Check parameter count with the method specs.
- Finish reiterating the MethodBuilder to use the properties only and add
  bytecode debugging references.
- meat should be able to compile directly from the dev files.
- When compiling to c++ native code the output should not be sent to cout
  but rather to a file like the library files

* Archive files
- Currently special code is required for the serialization of Null and 
  Boolean object due to their singlton like nature.

* Documentation
