The Meat Programming Language
=============================

REQUIREMENTS
============

GNU Automake & Autoconf tools
GNU C++ Compiler Suite

On Window Platforms
 The GNU tools are provided with the mingw system.

On Apple and Other Platforms
 Currently it's completely untests. So you're on your own.

 Currently the suite does use features that are specific to GNU's compilers.
This may change in the future, but for now that is how it is.

INSTALL
=======

 Building and installing uses the standard GNU automake/autoconf tools. So the
following configure/make will work.

./configure
make
make check
make install

 The above will work, but ideally the following compiling flags shown be set
during the configure stage.

CXXCFLAGS="-Wall -pedantic -O2" ./configure

USAGE
=====

To compile libraries:

meat-grinder my-library.meat
meat-grinder my-program.meat

 A simple interpreter to build data files. Note this *NOT* how meat code should
be executed.

meat-grinder -s make-data-file.meat

Executing libraries or data files with an Application class set:

meat my-program.mlib
meat my-program.mar

See the man pages for further details and options.
